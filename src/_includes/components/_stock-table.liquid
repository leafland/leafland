        <p>The <b>grade size</b> is the size of the bag/pot the tree is in. This is measured in either litres or pints per bag.</p>

        <p>The <b>height</b> is the overall height of the tree from the top of the pot/bag (bottom of the trunk) to the top of the tree. Some grades have height ranges as the heights of the individual trees vary.</p>

        <p>The <b>standard height</b> is the height of the clear trunk from the bottom of the trunk to the graft or the first branch (if it is not grafted).</p>

        <p>Grades that are <b>in production</b> are not yet ready for sale. You can place a pre-order for a 50% deposit and we will hold the stock until it is ready. Enquire if interested.</p>

        <p>Prices subject to change without notice. Actual stock quantity may differ. Heights are given in good faith but we give no guarantee as to the height of the final product due to natural variables beyond our control.</p>
