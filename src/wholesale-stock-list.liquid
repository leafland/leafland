        <p>The <b>grade size</b> is the size of the bag/pot the tree is in. This is measured in either litres or pints per bag.</p>

        <p>The <b>height</b> is the overall height of the tree from the top of the pot/bag (bottom of the trunk) to the top of the tree. Some grades have height ranges as the height of the individual trees vary.</p>

        <p>The <b>standard height</b> is the height of the clear trunk from the bottom of the trunk to the graft or the first branch (if it is not grafted).</p>

        <p>Grades that are <b>in production</b> are not yet ready for sale. You can place a pre-order for a 50% deposit and we will hold the stock until it is ready. Enquire if interested.</p>

        <p>Prices subject to change without notice. Actual stock quantity may differ. Heights are given in good faith but we give no guarantee as to the height of the final product.</p>
