    "description": "The leaves of this tree are green with silver-grey spots when young, but they turn into a dark-green color with silver-grey undersides as they mature. This tough and fast-growing plant is ideal for hedging and screening, and it is well-suited to tolerate both drought and salt-laden winds. It can be grown in either sun or shade and is known to produce highly fragrant and sweet-scented white flowers in autumn, which are then followed by orange berries in the winter. Overall, this tree makes for a very robust and resilient hedge. <i>Elaeagnus</i> x <i>submacrophylla</i> is evergreen, not native to New Zealand, and a hybrid between <a href='https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/21344/elaeagnus-macrophylla/details' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><i>Elaeagnus macrophylla</i></a> and <a href='https://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu/plants/elaeagnus-pungens' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><i>Elaeagnus pungens</i></a>. <i>Elaeagnus</i> x <i>submacrophylla</i> was first discovered in 1929 by Simon Doorenbos, the director of the Parks Department in The Hague, Netherlands.

    "description": "<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> 'Gumball' has a dense, rounded ball-shaped growth habit and features maple-shaped leaves that turn brilliant shades of purple, orange, yellow, and red in the autumn. These leaves often persist well into the winter, providing an extended period of seasonal interest. <i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> 'Gumball' is an excellent choice as a street tree or for formal planting, and it does not produce seed capsules. However, it's important to note that in dry soil, this tree produces a taproot that helps reinforce it against wind, but in wetter soil, it only grows superficial roots and cannot tolerate much wind. <i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> is native from central and eastern United States to Central America. <a href='https://treesandshrubsonline.org/articles/liquidambar/liquidambar-styraciflua/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Learn more about <i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i></a>. <i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> 'Gumball' was discovered by Hiram Stubblefield of Forest Nursery in Tennessee, United States around 1965.",
